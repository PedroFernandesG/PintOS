# Objectives
### Edit and implement functions in the threads part to solve:

* Alarm Clock
* Advanced Scheduler - Multi-Level Feedback Queue (mlfqs);

### We simulated it using the qemu software, if you don't have it installed, run the command below in the terminal:

```
sudo apt install qemu-system-i386
```

### Inside the src/threads directory, you can please run ```pintos --qemu -- run alarm-multiple```, this line runs the ```alarm-multiple``` test, you can check the other tests and what they do. To run everything at once, go into thread/builds and run the command ```make check```
